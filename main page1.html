 History:
The first documented computer architecture was in the correspondence between Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace,
 describing the analytical engine.When building the computer Z1 in 1936, Konrad Zuse described in two patent applications
for his future projects that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data, i.e., the stored-programconcept.[3][4] Two other early and important examples are:
John von Neumann's 1945 paper, First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, which described an organization of logical elements;[5] and
Alan Turing's more detailed Proposed Electronic Calculator for the Automatic Computing Engine, also 1945 and which cited John von Neumann's paper.[6]

Definition:
Computer architecture is concerned with balancing the performance, efficiency, cost,
 and reliability of a computer system. The case of instruction set architecture can be used to illustrate the balance of these competing factors
 More complex instruction sets enable programmers to write more space efficient programs,since a single instruction can encode some higher-level abstraction (such as the x86 Loop instruction).
 However, longer and more complex instructions take longer for the
processor to decode and can be more costly to implement effectively.

The increased complexity from a large instruction set also creates more room for unreliability when instructions interact in unexpected ways.
